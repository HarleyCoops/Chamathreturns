1. Private-equity performance terms (quick reference)
Term (acronym)	What it means in a PE/VC fund	Why it matters
Paid-In Capital (PIC)	Aggregate cash actually drawn from limited partners (LPs).	The denominator for every multiple; shows the investors’ total cash at risk.
Carrying Value (CV)	Current fair-value mark of the unrealised portfolio plus any residual cash or working capital still inside the fund.	Gives the size of what is left to turn into cash; adds to distributions to form “total value.”
Gross IRR	Internal Rate of Return on all fund cash-flows before management fees, fund expenses, and carried interest.	Pure asset-selection skill; useful for benchmarking the GP’s picking ability.
Net IRR	IRR after fees, expenses and carry—the number LPs actually see.	The most important headline number for investors.
TVPI (Total Value to Paid-In)	
(
Distributions + Carrying Value
)
/
PIC
(Distributions + Carrying Value)/PIC. A multiple of total value created. “Gross” vs “Net” follow the same fee logic as IRRs.	Captures both realised and unrealised upside in one ratio; widely used for vintage-year benchmarking.
DPI (Distributions to Paid-In)	
Cash Distributions
/
PIC
Cash Distributions/PIC. Measures only realised value returned.	A liquidity measure: tells you how much money is already back in LPs’ pockets.

3. What the numbers are telling us
Observation	Why it is interesting / odd
Fund II (2013) dominates the cohort	Top-decile style metrics across the board—Gross TVPI 5.9 × and Net IRR 26 %. Both realised (DPI 3.4 ×) and unrealised (TVPI-DPI spread) value are large, implying a genuinely exceptional vintage.
Carrying Value = Paid-In for five funds	If carrying value sat exactly at cost after >9 years, total value would be understated versus the very high TVPIs shown (e.g., Fund II needs CV ≈ $2.1 B to reconcile). The equality suggests either (i) the column is rounded to the nearest $M and coincidentally matches, or (ii) the firm is presenting CV at cost rather than marked-to-market—unusual given current PE reporting norms (ASC 820/IFRS 13).
Proprietary Capital’s unusual mix	Despite a Gross IRR 29 % only 1.5 × TVPI and 0.9 × DPI hint that: (a) the fund is very young (2019 start) so the IRR is inflated by short duration, and (b) almost all value is still unrealised (low DPI, CV> PIC). Good mark-ups, but liquidity risk remains.
Identical Gross and Net DPI in Opportunities II	A 1.4 × multiple realised with zero fee drag is atypical; usually carried interest triggers above 1.0 ×. Could mean (i) distributions are still below preferred return & carry hurdle, (ii) GP has waived carry, or (iii) data entry error.
Fee drag varies widely	Spread between Gross and Net IRR:
• Fund III: -6.9 pp • Fund II: -8.7 pp • Prop Cap: -10.2 pp (largest). Larger spreads can stem from higher incentive fees or shorter capital runway locking in the 2 & 20 economics.
Maturity profile shows in DPI	Fund I & II have Net DPI ≥ 2.1 × / 3.4 × respectively—LPs have already more than doubled their cash. Funds 2015+ show < 1.3 ×, consistent with being mid-cycle.

4. Take-aways for an LP or analyst
Vintage 2013 (Fund II) is the clear out-performer and would pull up any pooled-portfolio return.

Reported carrying values need clarification—are they at fair value or at cost? Reconciling TVPI math suggests under-reporting of unrealised marks.

Proprietary Capital looks promising but unproven: high mark-ups, no cash back yet, and wide fee drag. Worth monitoring realisations.

Fee efficiency differs markedly across vehicles; understanding GP economics and offsets (e.g., recycling, GP give-backs) is essential before extrapolating Net returns to future funds.

Opportunities II quirk (Gross = Net DPI) warrants a data check or legal review of hurdle mechanics.
